# CSCI4300-Project2
A peer-to-peer Rock, Paper, Scissors game developed in Java using OCSF library.
This was one of my final projects at UCA. This project was meant to demonstration understanding with programming with sockets and threadable objects in any language and with any library. I chose Java and the OCSF library (http://www.site.uottawa.ca/school/research/lloseng/supportMaterial/ocsf/ocsf.html) from the University of Ottawa, a library used extensively in Software Engineering (CSCI 4490). The OCSF library helps abstract the networking programming through its classes.
